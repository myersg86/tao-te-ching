Tao \(the Way\) is infused into nature,  
and constantly put to use  
without ever being exhausted.

Tao is deep and subtle,   
like an abyss,  
that is the origin of all things.  
  
It is complete and perfect  
with a wholeness that:  
rounds sharp edges  
and resolves confusion.  
It harmonizes with glory  
as it acts in unison with the universe.

We should blunt our sharp points,  
unravel the complications of things;  
we should soften our brightness,   
and bring ourselves into agreement  
with the obscurity of others.

Tao is so profound,  
yet it is invisible.  
It exists anywhere,  
and everywhere.

I do not know who gave birth to Tao.  
It appears to have existed before Heaven and Earth.
