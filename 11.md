Many spokes share the wheel's hub;   
but it is the center hole that allows it to turn.

Shape clay into a vessel;   
It is the empty space within that makes it useful. 

Hammer wood to build a house,  
the inner space is what makes it livable.

Cut doors and windows for a room;   
It is the holes that make it usable.

Therefore benefit comes from what is there;   
Usefulness from what is not there.

We work with being,  
but non-being is what we use.
