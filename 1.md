The tao that can be described,  
is not the eternal Tao.

There are many paths to take  
but the Tao is uncharted.

The name that can be spoken is transient,  
the Tao is everlasting.

  
Therefore, the Tao is truly nameless.  
  
While things have a mother or creator,  
the Tao is like the source of creation itself.
