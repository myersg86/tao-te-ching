Life can be simple and easy,   
but people prefer to make it difficult. 

Be aware when things are out of balance,   
always stay centered.

When rich speculators prosper while farmers lose their land;  
when governments spend tax money on weapons instead of cures;  
when the upper class is extravagant and irresponsible,  
while the poor have nowhere to turn -  
all this is robbery and chaos. 

This is not the natural order of the universe,  
it is not sustainable,  
it is not the way to enlightenment.
