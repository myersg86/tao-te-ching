# 36

Anything that shrinks,  
has already expanded.

Anything that fails,  
used to be a success.

Anything put down,  
must first rise up.

Before receiving,  
there must be giving.

This is the nature of things,  
subtle and profound.

Gentleness overcomes force,   
the meek overcome the strong.

Flexible things endure,  
Rigid things are short-lived.  
  
The meek overcome those who are self-assured.  
The weak eventually overcome the strong.

Fishes should not be taken from the deep,  
a state's wealth and weapons should not be displayed.

Let your workings remain a mystery.  
Just show people the results.
