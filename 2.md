As soon as beauty is known by the world as beautiful,  
it begets ugly.   
As soon as virtue is being known as something good,  
it begets evil.   
Difficult and easy,  
accomplish each other.  
Long and short,  
form each other.   
High and low,  
distinguish each other.   
Sound and tone,  
harmonize each other   
Before and after,  
follow each other as a sequence. 

Being and non-being,  
give birth to each other.

Realizing this,   
the saint performs effortlessly  
according to the natural Way  
without personal desire,  
and practices wordless teaching through actions and deeds. 

The saint inspires the vitality of all lives,  
without holding back.   
\(s\)he nurtures all beings  
with no wish to take possession of.   
\(s\)he devotes all energy,  
but has no intention to hold on to the merit.   
When success is achieved,  
\(s\)he seeks no recognition.   
Because \(s\)he does not claim credit,  
\(s\)he shall never lose it.
