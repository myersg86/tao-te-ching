She who is centered in the Tao  
can go where she wishes, without danger.  
She perceives the universal harmony,  
even amid great pain,  
because she has found peace in her heart.  
  
Music or the smell of good cooking  
may make people stop and enjoy.  
But words that point to the Tao  
seem monotonous and without flavor.  
When you look for it, there is nothing to see.  
When you listen for it, there is nothing to hear.  
When you use it, it is inexhaustible.
