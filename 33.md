One who knows others is wise,  
One who knows the self is enlightened. 

Mastering others takes force,  
Mastering the self takes strength.

One who overcomes others is brawny;   
One who overcomes their self is truly powerful.

Determination and perseverance strengthen one's will. 

Those content with what they have are truly rich.

Those who embrace their true nature shall long live,  
and though their physical body dies,  
they are eternally united with the everlasting Tao.
