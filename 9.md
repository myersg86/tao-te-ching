# 9

Fill your bowl to the brim  
and it will surely spill.

Oversharpen a blade  
and the sharper it gets,  
the easier it is to break.

Wealth and treasures are but illusions  
that one cannot possess.

When gold and jade fill one's vaults,   
their possessors cannot keep them safe.

When wealth and honor lead to arrogance,  
disaster is sure to follow.

Chase after money and security,  
and your heart will never unclench.

Care about people's approval  
and you will be their prisoner.

Do your work, then step back.  
This is the path to serenity.
