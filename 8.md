The highest good is like \(that of\) water.

Water benefits and nourishes all things,   
without striving or effort.

Water is content to flow  
even in places that men reject,  
and so it is like the Tao.

In dwelling, stay close to the land.   
In thinking, keep to the simple.  
In meditation, go deep.  
In conflict, be fair and generous.  
In speech, be true.  
In dealing with others, be gentle and kind.   
In ruling, be just.  
In governing, don't try to control.  
In work, do what you love.  
In daily life, be completely present.  
  
Without fighting.  
Without blame.

When you are content to be simply yourself  
and you don't compare or compete,  
everybody will respect you.
