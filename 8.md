The highest excellence is like \(that of\) water.

Water benefits and nourishes all things, without effort.

Water is content to flow in places that men reject,  
and so it is like the Tao.

In dwelling, be close to the land.   
In meditation, go deep in the heart and soul  
In dealing with others, be gentle and kind.   
In speech, be true.   
In ruling, be just.   
In daily life, be competent.   
In action, be aware of the time and the season.

No fight: No blame.

A virtuous person is like water which adapts itself to the perfect place. His mind is like the deep water that is calm and peaceful. His heart is kind like water that benefits all. His words are sincere like the constant flow of water. His governing is natural without desire which is like the softness of water that penetrates through hard rocks. His work is of talent like the free flow of water. His movement is of right timing like water that flows smoothly. A virtuous person never forces his way and hence will not make faults.
